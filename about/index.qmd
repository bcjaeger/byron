## Hello, and thanks for visiting!

I'm a biostatistician and data scientist in the [Wake Forest University School of Medicine](https://school.wakehealth.edu/)

## Research

My research interests include random forests, prediction modeling, blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and cognition. I work in clinical trials such as [SPRINT](https://www.sprinttrial.org/public/dspHome.cfm), [LEAP](https://school.wakehealth.edu/features/research/leaps-and-bounds-new-ways-to-treat-obesity), and [MoTrPAC](https://motrpac.org/). My roles include data coordination, dynamic reporting, simulation, and analysis. I'm the developer of [`aorsf`](https://docs.ropensci.org/aorsf/), an R package with fast routines to fit oblique random forests for classification, regression, and survival outcomes. I work with cognitive science experts to develop robust prediction models that can help direct cognitive screening to patients who may be at risk for developing cognitive impairment or dementia. I believe in opening science up and making it simpler, so that it's easier for everyone to participate. A great example of this is the hypertension statistics [web application](https://bcjaeger.shinyapps.io/nhanesShinyBP/) I developed with my colleagues in the Jackson Heart Study Hypertension Working Group. It's free, try it out! There are online tutorials for it [here](https://jhs-hwg.github.io/cardioStatsUSA/index.html) and a paper [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10424908/).

## Teaching

I love to teach and learn new things. I'm currently teaching THSS 730: Introduction to Biostatistics. A few other teaching activities are my [workshop on random forests for prediction and inference](https://bcjaeger.github.io/melodem-apoe4-het/), my [demo of the aorsf package](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJoGmQapvf0), and my all-time favorite class, [Introduction to R](http://bst680.rbind.io/).
