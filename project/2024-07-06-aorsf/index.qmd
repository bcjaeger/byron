The `aorsf` package is a software project dedicated to oblique random forests. It was originally the `obliqueRSF` package introduced in the [oblique random survival forest paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36704751/), and had trouble with inefficiency and lack of features for interpretation. Today, it has grown into an R package that efficiently fits oblique random forests for classification, regression, and survival, with customized features to interpret them.

When `aorsf` was reviewed by R OpenSci, one of my reviewers was Marvin N. Wright, author of the `ranger` package. At the time, `aorsf` was only designed to fit oblique random survival forests, and one of Marvin's [review comments](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/532/#issuecomment-1235275312) was

> What about oblique RF for classification and regression? Do other packages implement the speedups used here? If not, why not have a fast oblique RF package for all outcomes instead of a specific one for survival?

It was a great question. Over the years there have been packages that provide specific types of oblique random forests, like [`obliqueRF`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=obliqueRF), [`RLT`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLT), [`rotationForest`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rotationForest), and others. But, as far as I know, there was never an R package that brought oblique random forests together.

microbenchmark(
 obliqueRSF = ORSF(data = flc, 
                   time = 'futime', 
                   status = 'death', 
                   ntree = 10, 
                   verbose = FALSE),
 aorsf = orsf(futime + death ~ ., 
              data = flc, 
              n_tree = 10),
 times = 1
)

```
